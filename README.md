# Hospital Management Systems
Hey, this is a project of hospital managament systems I created as my college assignment.
The design for it is developed using VB.net for code implementation and 
MS Access as a database.
The project helps the user to maintain, fetch and update records as per use.
In this every patient is identified using a Unique id which is alphanumeric. The first
3 letters of the first name, 3 of the last name and the patient's birth date combined
create this unique ID for him. 
The data can also be fetched by the user on the basis of the department the patient is 
admitted into, the doctor treating him and ofcourse his ID. 
The project is a very basic version of what actually works in the field.
